        with Reserved Font Name FontAwesome<br>
        <br>
        PREAMBLE<br>
        The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide<br>
        development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation<br>
        efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and<br>
        open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership<br>
        with others.<br>
        <br>
        The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and<br>
        redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The<br>
        fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, <br>
        redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved<br>
        names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,<br>
        however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The<br>
        requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply<br>
        to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.<br>
        <br>
        DEFINITIONS<br>
        "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright<br>
        Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may<br>
        include source files, build scripts and documentation.<br>
        <br>
        "Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the<br>
        copyright statement(s).<br>
        <br>
        "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as<br>
        distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).<br>
        <br>
        "Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,<br>
        or substituting — in part or in whole — any of the components of the<br>

        new environment.<br>
        <br>
        "Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical<br>
        writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.<br>

        PERMISSION & CONDITIONS<br>
        Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining<br>
        a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,<br>
        redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font<br>
        Software, subject to the following conditions:<br>
        <br>
        1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,<br>
        in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.<br>
        <br>
        2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,<br>
        redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy<br>
        contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be<br>
        included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or<br>
        in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or<br>
        binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.<br>
        <br>
        3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font<br>
        Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding<br>
        Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as<br>
        presented to the users.<br>
        <br>
        4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font<br>
        Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any<br>
        Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the<br>
        Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written<br>
        permission.<br>
        <br>
        5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,<br>
        must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be<br>

        <br>
            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object<br>

            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes<br>
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain<br>
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,<br>
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br>
        <br>
            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including<br>
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions<br>

            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner<br>
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of<br>
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"<br>
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent<br>

            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the<br>
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but<br>

        <br>

            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and<br>

        <br>
         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br>
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br>
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br>
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,<br>
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the<br>
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.<br>
        <br>
         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br>
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br>
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br>
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,<br>
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,<br>
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable<br>
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br>
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br>
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You<br>
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br>
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br>
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br>
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br>
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br>
            as of the date such litigation is filed.<br>
        <br>
         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br>
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br>
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br>
            meet the following conditions:<br>
        <br>
            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br>
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br>
        <br>
            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
                stating that You changed the files; and<br>
        <br>
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br>
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br>
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br>
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br>
                the Derivative Works; and<br>
        <br>
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br>
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br>
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br>
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br>
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br>
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br>
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br>
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br>
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br>
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br>
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br>
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br>
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br>
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br>
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br>
                as modifying the License.<br>
        <br>
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br>
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br>
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br>
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br>
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br>
            the conditions stated in this License.<br>
        <br>
         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br>
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br>
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br>
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br>
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br>
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br>
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br>
        <br>
         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br>
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br>
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br>
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br>
        <br>
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br>
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br>
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br>
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br>
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br>
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br>
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br>
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br>
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br>
        <br>
         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br>
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br>
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br>
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br>
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br>
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br>
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br>
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br>
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br>
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br>
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br>
        <br>
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br>
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br>
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br>
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br>
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br>
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br>
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br>
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br>
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br>
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br>
        <br>

         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.<br>
        <br>
            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following<br>
            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"<br>
            replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include<br>
            the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate<br>
            comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a<br>
            file or class name and description of purpose be included on the<br>
            same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier<br>
            identification within third-party archives.<br>
